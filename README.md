# Note

* Time complexity: `O(V * E)` where `V` and `E` is the number of vertexes and edges respectively.
* Space complexity: `O(V * E)` where `V` and `E` is the number of vertexes and edges respectively.
* I test with `C++20` so please use `C++20` to compile project.
* I used `Visual Studio with MSVC` to write and test the code, however, I think it is also fine if you use `g++`.
